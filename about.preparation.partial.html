        traditional recipes with new approaches.

        While cooking our burgers, we use only certified Piedmontese beef which
        means that it is nourishing and soft by nature, has minimum calories and
        fat but has a high protein level. This meat is the result of a special
        feature of the Piedmontese breed, which lies in the development of lean,
        heavy musculature in the production of beef, which does not depend on fat
        marbling (as a rule in other breeds of cattle) to reach softness.
        Certified Piedmontese cattle are grown without using any steroids, growth
        hormones, or antibiotics, which ensures the highest quality and nutrient
        beef.
